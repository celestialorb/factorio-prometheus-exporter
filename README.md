# factorio-prometheus-exporter

A mod for Factorio to produce a variety of Prometheus metrics.

## Design

This project produces two artifacts: the first being a ZIP archive of the
Factorio mod, and the second being a container image to read in the output of
the mod and expose Prometheus metrics on a web endpoint.

## Metrics

Below is a table of metrics that are exported in this version of the exporter.

| Metric                                       | Labels                                  | Description                                                                             |

| `factorio_game_ticks_paused`                 | N/A                                     | Whether or not the game is currently paused.                                            |
| `factorio_items_launched`                    | `force`, `name`                         | The total number of items launched for a force.                                         |

| `factorio_pollution_consumption`             | `source`, `surface`                     | The current pollution consumption total for a given source on a surface.                |
| `factorio_pollution_production`              | `source`, `surface`                     | The current pollution production total for a given source on a surface.                 |
| `factorio_rockets_launched`                  | `force`                                 | The total number of rockets launched for a force.                                       |
| `factorio_surface_pollution_total`           | `surface`                               | The total pollution across the surface.                                                 |
| `factorio_surface_ticks_per_day`             | `surface`                               | The total number of ticks per day across the surface.                                   |

## Artifacts

As stated in the Design section, this project produces two artifacts.

The first is [the Factorio mod](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/factorio-prometheus-exporter)
itself that produces a JSON file containing the raw metric data. This will need
to be installed in your game / server.

The second is [the container image](https://github.com/celestialorb/factorio-prometheus-exporter/pkgs/container/factorio-prometheus-exporter)
that reads in the raw metrics file whenever the Prometheus metrics are
requested.
